# Game of Software

The idea for this repository is loosely based on Sandi Metz's book
[99 Bottles of OOP](https://sandimetz.com/99bottles). But instead of focussing only
on OOP the goal is to provide to provide an introduction to different aspects
of software engineering in Python.

Starting from a basic implementation of
[Conway's Game Of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life)
the following aspects will be shown:

- Folder structure for python projects
- Pythonic code
- Unit tests
- Useful Python standard libraries
- Object oriented vs. functional programming
