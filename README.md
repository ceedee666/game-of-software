# Game of Software
The idea for this repoisitory is loosley based on Sandi Metz's book [99 Bottles of OOP](https://sandimetz.com/99bottles). But instead of focussing only
on OOP the goal is to provide to provide an introduction to different aspects of software engineering in Python. 

Starting from a basic implementation of [Conway's Game Of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) the following aspects will be shown:
- Useful Python standard libraries
- Unit tests
- Object otriented vs. functional programming
- ....
